				<h3 class="faqtitle">What is COVID-19?</h3>
				<p class="faqcontent">COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with
					COVID-19
					have mild symptoms, but some people can become
					severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people
					experience post-COVID conditions. Post-
					COVID conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can
					experience more than four weeks after first
					being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain
					underlying medical conditions are more likely to
					get severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and effective.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faqs">
				<h3 class="faqtitle">Should I use soap and water or hand santizer to protect myself?</h3>
				<p class="faqcontent">Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from
					getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at
					least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom;
					and before eating or preparing food. If
					soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60%
					alcohol.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="faqs">
				<h3 class="faqtitle">What are the symptoms and complications that COVID-19 can cause?</h3>
				<p class="faqcontent">People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms - from mild symptoms
					to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days
					after exposure to the virus. If you have fever, cough, or other symptoms, you might have COVID-19.
